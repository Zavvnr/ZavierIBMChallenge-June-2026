"""
Seed `mlangcast.context` with embedded football-context docs, then run a
sample vector search to prove the index works end to end.

This script also doubles as your connection check — if MONGODB_URI is wrong,
the insert will fail loudly.

Prereqs:
    pip install google-genai "pymongo[srv]"
    .env (or exported env vars) with:
        GEMINI_API_KEY=...
        MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://USER:PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/mlangcast?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Run:
    python seed_context.py
